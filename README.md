#A simple Library Management System built in Python. It models a library system that allows clients to borrow and return books, as well as check the availability of books

#Features of the System:
-Borrowing and Returning Books: Clients can borrow and return books. The system keeps track of borrowed and available books, adjusting the statistics accordingly.
-Book Availability Check: Clients can check if a book is available in the library before requesting it. If the book is not available, the system notifies the client.
-Basic Client Interaction: Clients interact with the system via a text-based menu. They can request and return books based on their choices.
-Real-Time Updates: The system updates book availability and library statistics in real time after each action (borrow/return).
-Track Borrowing Orders: The system tracks borrowed books and their corresponding clients, updating the statistics as books are borrowed and returned.

#Problems Solved:
-Book Availability: The system solves the problem of checking whether a book is available or not in real time. Clients are informed if the book they want is unavailable.
-Borrowing and Returning Process: The system automates the process of borrowing and returning books, ensuring that books are correctly tracked and availability is updated dynamically.
-Client and Library Interaction: The system simplifies interactions between clients and the library by providing a user-friendly menu. Clients can easily request or return books, and the system handles the logic for them.
-Inventory Management: The libraryâ€™s book inventory is effectively managed, allowing the system to keep track of the number of books available and borrowed at any given time.
